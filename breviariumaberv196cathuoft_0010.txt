iv THE PREFAGE.

'rho anvuamu was a work of a more general complexion, and, excepting
the Daily Service of the Mass, contained the entire Offices throughout the
year. It was formed ιιι the eleventh century out of the several books of
Divino Offices, the Psalterium, the Antiphonarium, the Hymnarium, the
Martyrologium, διο. and contained the prayers, hymns, and lessons, ordained
to be recited or sung at certain hours of the day and night, known as the
Canonical Hours. In this comprehensive work which supplied the priest-
hood with a complete manual of devotione, its scripture and patristic les-
sons served as a substitute for the Holy Scriptures. For convenience, it
was frequently divided into two parts, the oue for the Summer, the other for
the Winter half of the year.¹ “ The Breviary (in the words of Mr Maskell)
in its full and settled state, say from the» twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
contained the whole Offices of 'the OanonicalHours throughout the year—
of the great festivals, the saints-days, the Sundays, and the week-days.
These were arranged under their respective days, with rubrics directing to
certain prayem, hymns, or psalms, which occurred frequently, or to the
Psalter, which formed part of the volume. The rubrics of Breviaries in
manuscript will be found to vary much in their fulness, as they happen to
have been written for the use of churches or monasteries, of which the
Ordinals had been drawn up. Thus some would have but very few ; others
again as many in comparison. Not that we are to suppose by any means
that the existence of an Ordinal always led to the omission of rubrics in
the Breviary3 for the Ordinal itself might be more or less complete, and
both might continue to give, with relation to certain parts os the Office,
what we may call duplicate directions.” ² .

Another book which, at a later period, came into very general use, was
the Hours of the Virgin. This work, the Home uum-2 Vmomts Mam,
