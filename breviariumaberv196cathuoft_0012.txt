It is not necessary to enquire into the history of the Litnrgies of the
British Ohurches at a remote period. The Canon or invariable part of the
BomanLiturgy corresponds so closely with that portion of the service in
all the Western churches, as to suggest one common origin3 and this, with-
out being mutilate'd or altered, may be traced back to the time of Gregory
the Great. He cannot however be considered as the author, having only
collected, arranged, and improved the collecte of the various Missae? The
Liturgy of Gaul can likewise be traced to a very remote period; and it is

orders from the Gallican rather than the Roman Ohurch, they had also
adopted the ritual services of the former.⁴ The Roman forms, it is generally ·
allowed, were introduced into England by St Augustin, about the year 600.
It is however historically certain that the Christian Ohurch had been esta-

Gregory the Great3 bnt at what period and to what extent the Roman
Liturgy may have superseded either the Scuto-Irish or the Anglo-Saxon
