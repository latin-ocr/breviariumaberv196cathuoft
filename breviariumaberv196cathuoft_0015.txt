THE PREFAGE. ix

purpose, the oblation of ’ the Sacrifice3 the Oourse had in view a more
general object, to supply matter for prayer at the canonical hours, and was
therefore more susceptible of diversity of form and arrangement. Hence it
happened that not only in national churches, but even in neighbouring
churches of the same nation, considerable discrepancies existed in the per-
formance of the choral service ..... In the arrangement of the Psalms for
the several hours of prayer, the selection of lessons and capitula, the form
of the responsorios and collects, the order of the diocesan· calendar, and
the adaptation of epistles and gospels to votive masses and local festivals,
numerous diversities continued to exist3 for in these points Bishops and
Abbots, the founders of churches and monasteries, and often the successors
of the founders, looking upon themselves as legislators for their own sub-
jectS‚ assumed the liberty of making innovations and improvements, or of
borrowing those already made by others.’' ¹

In the latter part of the fifteenth century there prevailed a tradition that
the Usages of Sarum were first introduced into Scotland by Edward the
First, who, in his devastations in the year 1292, caused all the Service
books os the Ghurch of Rome to be collected and destroyed, and by force
constrained the Sarum ritual to be adopted. Henry the Minstrel, in his
metrical history of Sir William Wallace, has the following passage in refer—
ence to this subject 2— ’

The Bischoppis all inclynit to his Croun,

Baith Temporall and the Religioun.

The Romane buikis that thar wer in Scotland,

He gart tharne beir to Scene, quhair thay tharne fand,
And, but redeme, thay brynt thame all ilk ane:
Salisbery Use, our Clerkis than hes tane?
