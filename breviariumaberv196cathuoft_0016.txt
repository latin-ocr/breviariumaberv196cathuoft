x THE PREFACE.

Among the letters of Father lanes, we find that his friend Mr Edgar
of Rome, Secretary to the old Pretender, had directed his attention to
these lines3 and in reply he says, “ As to the verses of Wallace book you
desire to have my thoughts of, they concern the ancient Liturgies of the
Scots‚ upon which, among other heads of our Antiquities, Ι formerly began
a draught of a Dissertation. I shall look out for it, and endeavour to give
you all the satisfaction I can with the soonest.” ¹ The Dissertation here
mentioned is not preserved; but in a letter four days later, he gives the
result of his researches on the subject, exhibiting in an eminent degree the

by Edward 1. during bis invasion, he says, ‘⁴ Subacta vero Scotia, omnes consuetudines
veteres, omnibus in rebus Scotorum Edwardus abolere statuit . · . . Itaque historias omnes
Scotorum, omnia sacrarum juxta atque prophanatum rerum volumina concremari ubique
precepit, magns decreta poena qui praeceptum contempsisset. Libros Same Anqzico ritu
