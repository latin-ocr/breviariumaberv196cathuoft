xiv THE PREFACE.

ously'resisted, may have originated in the decree of Pope Gregory- 111„ in
the eighth century, by which the Anglo-Saxon Bishoprics north of the
Humber were subjected to the authority os the Bishop of York3 and at
that early period the Lothians were included in Northumbria3 as parts of
Gumherland belonged to the Crown of Scotland. Lord Hailes, in his
Annals of Scotland, under the years 1118 to 1123, has given a full account
of the disputes which took place in regard to the nomination and conse-

cration of Bishop Turgot’s successor to the See of St Andrews, involving · ·

the pretensions of the Archbishop of York as Metropolitan in scotland.
This was during the reign of Alexander the First) In 1126, John of
crema, a Cardinal priest‚ Legate from Pope Honorius II„ appeared, in
Scotland, and held a council at Bokesburgh. The Pope proposed, that the
question concerning these protensione, and the liberties of the Scottish
Ghurch, should be examined in this council 3 but he reserved its final
determination to himself.² “ Before that time (says Pinkerton) there is
not a trace of any Papal power in Scotland.'' ³ By a Bull of Pope Olement
ΠΙ. in the year 1188, and a decretal epistle of Pope Gelestine ΙΙΙ. in 1191,
in answer to a mission from william the Lyon, the Scottish Church was
made independent of the See of York, and immediately subject to the
Apostolic See.⁴

It is of some importance to be able to ascertain what Ritual books actually
belonged to some of the chief religious establishments in Scotland at an
early period. Two or three ancient Inventories throw some light on this
of the churches in England, even by that of Canterbury ς but the church of York had proper
ngen of its own, of which 1 have seen some parts. But our countrymen took care to bor-
row nothing from York. least the aspiring Prelaoes of that See might take advantage from
it to strengthen their claim over our Ohurch: which, upon a thorough examination 1 made
formerly of that protension, 1 found to be groundless.”
