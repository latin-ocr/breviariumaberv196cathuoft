xx THE PREFACE.

ensis vsum ac consuetudinem, per anni circulum.” It contains the Iessons
from the Old and N ew Testament for the whole year3 and bears an inscrip-
tion, stating that it was written at Antwerp ‘by order of Gawin Dunbar,
Bisbop of Aberdeen‚ in 1527. The Calendar and portione of this handsome
volume are printed in the second volume of the Registrum Episcopatus
Aberdonensis, with a facsimile of some of the illuminated initial letters. In
the University Library, Edinburgh, is a manuscript on vellum of the same
period, written in large letters, and bearing this title: “ Incipit Martyrolo·
gium, secundum usum Ecclesie Aberdonen.” It is a general commemoration
of Saints under the respective festival days3 and its interest consists in
enumerating the churches dedicated to our local SaintS. The Calendar of
Ferne, in the possession of the Duke of Sutherland, had evidently formed
part of a Service book, in large folio, written in the fisteenth century. The
Abbey os Ferne, in the county of Ross, was founded in the reign of Alex-
ander ΙΙ. The Obit Book of the Ohurch of St John the Baptist, Ayr, from
the year 1306 to the end of the sixteenth century, is also preserved, and has
recently been published.¹ A few manuscript Psalters or Ohoral Books might
also be specified as preserved in different collections.² I however proceed to
the more immediate object of this Preface‚ by stating that previous to the
appearance of the Breviary of Aberdeen‚ no evidence has been discovered of
any attempt at providing the Scottish Church with a peculiar use or service.

The Basvusr or Asnaum cannot fail to be regarded with interest, from
the circumstances connected with its publication. The work was prepared
and completed under the personal superintendence of Wumm Eumn-
srous, Blsnor or Manum, a prelate who has obtained a high character
as an enlightened and liberal patron of learning. It may be inferred from
the words of his contemporary biographer, Hector Boyce, and other writerS,

eumer, one of the Canens of the monastery of Soone, prior to the Reformation.
