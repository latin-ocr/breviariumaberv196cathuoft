THE PREFACE. xxi

that several of the Lessons appointed in the Paornnm SANc'ronuM to be
read on the festivals of the Scottish Saints, either were written by the
Bishop himself, or were the result of researches instituted by his order
into the ecclesiastical annals' and traditione of the nation. That the work
was the result of great care and labour, need scarcely be remarked. For
the purpose of having it printed for general use, and under his immediate
inspection, we are fully warranted in attributing to this Prelate the scheme
which secured the establishment of a printing press in this country. More
than half a century had elapsed after the invention of Printing, and the
art had been practised in England by Oaxton and his successors for
upwards of thirty yeme, before any plan was contemplated to introduce
its benefits into Scotland. At length, on the l5th of September 1507,
J ames the Fourth made a grant of exclusive privileges to Walter Ohepman
and Andrew Myssar, two burgesses of Edinburgh‚ who had undertaken to
procure and bring home all the printing materials required, “ with expett
men to use the samyne,'' which could not be accomplished, it is said, “ with-
out rycht greit eost, labour, and expenS‚'’ for the purpose of “ imprenting
within our Realme of the bukis of our Lawis, Actis of Parliament, Oroniclis,
Mess :bukis, and Portuus ¹ efter the use of our Realme, with addicions and
legendis of Scottis San&is‚ now gaderit to be ekit tharto.”

In the same document it is further enacted, “ And alfe It is divifit and
thocht expedient be Us and. our Consall, that in tyme cuming Mess bukis,
Manualis, Matyne bukis, and Portuus bukis, efter our awin Scottis Use, and
with legendis of Scottis Sancti& as is now gaderit and ekit be ane Reverend
father in God, and our traist consalour Williame Bischope of Abirdene and
utheris, be usit generaly within al our Realme alffone as the sammyn may
be imprentit and providit, and that na maner of fic bukis of Salulbery Use
be brocht to be sauld within our Realme in 'tym cuming: and gif ony dois
in the contrair, that thay sal tyne the sammyne.” ² ι From this we learn that

² The name Portuus, Fortasse, οι· Portiforium‚ was frequently applied to the Breviary.
