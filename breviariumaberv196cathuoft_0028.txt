xxii THE PREFAcn.

the Breviary had already been prepared, although one volume was not
completed before 1509, and the other in the following year.

Of the earlier productione of Ohepman and Myllar's prees, a solitary
volume, with the date 1508, has reached our times. It consiste of metrioel

romanoe& and other poetical pieces, including some of the contemporary
productione of Dunbar.¹ As the name of Chepman alone appears as the
printer of the Breviary, we may conjecture that his partner Myllar was then
dead. That many similar productione continued to be printed is in some
measure ascertained by the discovery of a few mutilated leaves or fragments
of works no longer extant. Of the Breviary itsclf‚ only four copies more
or less imperfect are known.¹⁸ The increasing importance attached to such
works, suggested more than one attempt to have it preserved in an accessible
form by a carcful and accurate republication. This has at length been
accomplished, with no ordinary degree of elegance and minute accuracy,
alikc creditable to the Editor, the Printer‚ and the Publisher. The labour
which this has exaeted more especially from the Editor, the Rev. Wmm
Bmw, A.M.‚ few persons are able fully to appreciate. 'Phe original is in
the size of ⁸ small octavo. In the reprint, page for page has been given,
the size of type being enlarged for the sake of distinctness ; and as it was
not desirable that the manifest blunders of the original printer should be
retained, the mode adopted by the learned Editor may be best explained
in his own words.³

¹ There is a faceimilc reprint of this volume, under the title of ‘⁴ The Knightly Tale of
Golagrus and Gawane, and other Ancient Poems. Printed at Edinburgh by W. Ohepman
and A. Myllar in the year M.D.viij. Reprinted M.Dcoc.xxvij.” 4to.

' These copies are, let, in the University Library, Edinburgh ; 2d, in the Library of the
Faculty of Advocates3 ad, in the Earl of Strathmore's Library at Glammes Castle3 and 4th,

one volume only in the Library of King's College, Aberdeen. The first of these is the only

copy that pensasses a title-page. There was also a copy, in Innes's time, in the Scots college
at Paris, but the sate of it is unknown.
