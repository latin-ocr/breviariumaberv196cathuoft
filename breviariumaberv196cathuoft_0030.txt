xxiv THE PREFACE.

early writers whose works still exist.. On this head, in the prospectus of
this republieation, it is remarked,—

‘⁴ The fragments of biography, indeed the legends and the hymns which
are here enshrined, preserve under the seal of church authority, much more
than is elsewhere recorded of that greatest of events in the Histoi-y of
Scotland, the conversion of her tribes to the Christian saith. In the
instance of some of the chief missione, such as those of Saint Ninian and
Saint Columba, Saint Kentigern and Saint Sors, the original materials
employed in the preparation of the work, have, in whole or in part,
deseended to our own day ; and the remarkable fidelity with which we find
these recited in its pages, warrants us in placing a high value upon the
accounts that are given of other apostles and early teachers‚ os whose pious
enterprise every older memorial has passed away. The frequent details of
this kind which the Breviary supplies, are scarcely more interesting in their
unlooked for novelty, than in their characteristic minuteness, which is such
as not unfrequently to surprise the provincial, or even the parochial anti-
quarian, by the commemoration of places once venerable in the religious
associations of a people, but now so forgotten, that the significant names
which were then impressed upon them, have long ceased to be understood.’'

Whether the great object contemplated by Bishop Elphinstone in this
Breviary was attained‚ in its being received throughout the Scottish Church‚
may at least be considered as extremely doubtful. In England a special
injnnction, issued by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and confirmed by an
Act of Parliament‚ was deemed necessary, when the Book of Oommon Prayer‚
of Edward the siah, was enjoined to be used, in place of “ the great diver-
sity of saying and siuging in churches within the realme.'’ But it is to be
observed that the imposition of the Aberdeen Service books, and the sup-
pression of all other forms, never received the sanction of ecclesiastical
authority, by any Canon of the Scottish Church3 and excepting the pecu-
liar differences in the Proper offices, adapted to Scotland, (several of which
might be esteemed as much more suitable for one diocese than another‚)
