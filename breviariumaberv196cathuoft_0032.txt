mentioned3 and it might here be deemed out of place to quote from the
public Records, various incidental notices of Ohepman and his occupatione,
from the year 1494 ιο, the end of the reign of James the Fourth. He
endowed, in 1518, a chaplainry at one of the altars, sud afterwards founded
a chapel in connexion with the collegiate Ohurch of St Giles in Edinburgh.
He appears to bave survived till the year 1530.

nummus. ’ His father, william Elphinstone, was Rector of Kirkmichael,
(1437,) a Canon of Glasgow‚ (1451 ιο 1483,) and Archdeacon of Teviotdale
(1482). He died in 1484. As a priest he could have no legitimate issue;
and his son william, who was born in Glasgow in the year 1437, must
have obtained letters of legitimation before he was admitted ιο holy order-e.
After completing his studies in the· newly erected University in his native
city, where he took his Master’s degree in 1462, he spent some years abroad,
chiefly at Paris and Orleans, in the study of the canon and the civil law. He
took the degree of Doctor of the Canon Law at Paris. Having returned to
Scotland, he held several successive appointments, was nominated Bishop
of Aberdeen in 1483, was much employed in public affiirs, and became the
founder of King’s College‚ Aberdeen, in 1494. He died on the 25th of
October 1514, in the eighty-third year of his ageJ
